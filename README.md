Here are just a couple example works that I have done. Although most of this is outdated it shows some of my coding stlye.
Most of these files are part of a project to integrate Ultracart into our existing website.


In these examples I am using json, ajax, jquery, php(pre 5.0), sql, XML.


I would prefer to use a more up-to-date version of PHP but due to restrictions at my current company, I cannot do that.
